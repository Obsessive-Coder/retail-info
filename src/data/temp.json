While I waited for the repairs that morning I decided to swing by and give this place a try as I always enjoy trying and supporting local cafes instead of chain restaurants. My server was excellent, she was a very nice lady and very professional. I believe I ordered french toast and a side of eggs/regular toast. I had quick service and my food was served hot. The food presentation/quality was excellent thanks to the great cook who was working, and it also tasted great! I absolutely will come by again if I ever am in the area! Highly recommend! Thanks for the excellent meal and keep up the great work! I hope I get to pass through town again sometime soon!",

Well-lit, nice big windows in the front to watch the world go by. Food was good, nothing stand-out, but still good. Our waitress was young and very pleasant, and took good care of us perfectly. The bad part was when we were getting ready to check out, and the grumpy old waitress also working there got all nasty with this other nice girl right in front of us, making it known that the next group of customers coming in were HERS.

Waitress was nice enough but the steaks were not seasoned and not cooked nearly enough. I ordered mine medium and it was barely done to a \"rare\" rating. I was not impressed with any part of the meal. Sad because it was a good cut of meat, just poor management with seating and preparations. It wasn't terrible, but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends. For the money, there are alot of better choices out there. Needless to say, I would not return here.",

Dehydration is so dangerous and I would NEVER recommend this establishment to anyone. This is not a issue that will be resolved through social media, a inspection of this restaurant is in order.",

However we were given a cone of ice cream and rather than make it right the older manager woman scraped the cone of ice cream with sprinkles into a dish and refused to admit that we ordered a dish. This made our two-year-old sad, but I guess it was a learning experience. You can’t always get what you want even after your parents think you should be rewarded. The manager decided to scrape her cone into a dish, with a much smaller amount of ice cream then her friend rather than giving her what we ordered. Her dish was a tiny scraping of ice cream. But thankfully her daughter is a good person and put up with it. Meanwhile the manager tried to make us feel bad as if it was our mistake.",

What a horrible way to treat a customer. The food was great and I believe if the cashier were to be disciplined or separated from the company I would eat there again. But until that rude employee is gone I suggest no one goes there to eat. Keep in mind all this drama came from me trying to pay with a $100 bill for 3 sandwidges Which is a legal tender and just about anywhere that is exchanging money can break. Without the rude behavior.",

Being early in the day on a Saturday, we were served and entertained by Aldo himself. What a genuine guy. He’s a character, alright. I have eaten calamari in the best restaurants in Chicago, New York and LA. Aldo’s is the finest I have had. The sandwiches were awesome, the fries were great. We look forward to going back. The only criticism we have is with price point. We spent $63 on a light late lunch with domestic beer. It was a great meal, but it is Rochelle, not downtown Chicago. Worth it, yes. In our budget, only occasionally. One more thing: Don’t charge a premium for using a debit card. It is 2019. No one carries cash.",

Kids had Chicken fingers and if you have kids you can appreciate it when \"they\"say\" mmm grandpa better than those chicken nuggets!\"  and chowed own with smiles.\nSo yes this was a good visit I think I'll be back, and to top it off this location just had a facelift inside and outside so fresh and clean all around.\nI'm full now gotta take a grandpa nap.\nCheck 'em out \"They have the BEEF\"",

My visit to this store tonight, I went in picked up what I wanted and went to check out. The two ladies behind the counter wouldn’t stop talking while I was trying to check out. Gave the cashier my money, she gave me my change, didn’t count it or tell me how much my change was. When I went to leave I didn’t get a thank you or have a good evening. Nope she just went back to talking with her coworker. How rude. Sorry I inconvenienced your employees tonight. It won’t happen again I wont be back! Thank you and have a good evening.",

Today, I ordered the same thing as my wife but no ketchup and mustard on my burger. When our order was brought to the table I asked which was without ketchup. \"The one without ketchup is the one without ketchup. I don't know.\" Was the reply from the cashier. It might seem petty. But his attitude just rubbed me the wrong way. \nFood was definitely better than last visit",

Due to snowy conditions and the odd traffic light, I had arrived and walked in the door at 3:31pm. I had told the individual working behind the counter that I had arrived for my interview. He then proceeded to get the attention of the hiring manager. They spoke with one another briefly, then told me to have a seat. I did so, and waited momentarily. The manager proceeds to approach me, sits down and says \"your interview was actually at 3:30.\" Confused, I ask \"is it not 3:30?\" She responds, \"it's 3:33...\"  shaking my hand, signaling the conclusion of our interview.",

Entertainment there was Karoake which I understand they have every Friday ad Saturday nights. Drinks are made well, and well priced. 2 pool tables, dart board, slot machines. So there is lots to do. The bar was busy and people were very friendly and lots of singers, so good variety. Since I only gave it 4 stars, there has to be a downside. For me the that would be a one stall womans bathroom for a bar this big. Girls if you're in a crowded bar that has a one toilet womans bathroom. You might want to not play on your phone during toilet time and if you want to have lesbian sex (which you felt the need to brag about). You might want to consider, i don't know, maybe....your car!!!",

We waited at least 20 minutes for food, everyone in the restaurant was cussing saying they hate their job, it was only them back there and saying F this F that, the cashier said what do you want when people went up to order. Customers were looking at each other in absolute shock! Then we get home to some weird burnt pieces added on top of our food and some inedible lump of dough shoved into a greasy breadstick bag! We will never, ever visit this location again! Terrible service, terrible food!! I would give no stars if I could! Just look at this food",

When I approached the counter to see about plates the employee looked at me as if I was bothering her and said the ones above the buffet where to be used. I grabbed several and every single one was dirty. It was disgusting. We ate off of napkins. I will never be back, this was the worst experience in a pizza hut that I've ever had.

We have ordered the same order for delivery and eat in quite a few times. Never had any issue. Until tonight. Our pizza sauce was off. It has bland as in no seasoning with a acidic taste. Very similar to straight tomato paste. My husband called to let them know. Thinking maybe the sauce had changed or someone forgot a seasoning packet. As my husband had worked for a couple pizza places.  Never once did he even ask for a new pizza or a credit. But the gentleman instantly began to argue with him. Customer service is extremely important. In Rochelle we have quite a few pizza options. We already don't patron another pizza place for witnesses a owner belittling an employee. We have no problem NOT sending our money here.",

But other then that it is an okay of a place, the fried pickles were over cooked and so was the spaghetti. I had to send back my wings due to them coming out incorrectly. But my husband's and father's dinners came out decent they ordered the combo. As for the restrooms the females restroom did not have any kind of soap to wash your hands when asked about the soap the waitress just kinda shrugged it off and said it was the managers job which she was gone for the day.",

Seated ourselves at a high top table and were immediately greeted by a waitress with menus and asked if we were ready to order drinks. Husband had a bottled beer and I had the lemon drop martini. These arrived very quickly. Our waitress gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. I had the black and bleu burger with fries and husband had the mushroom and Swiss burger with fries. Other options for sides included onion rings, sweet potato fries (add’l. $1) and waffle fries, among other things. Food arrived quickly and was very tasty. My one problem was a spot I the burger that wasn’t quite as well done as the rest, but not enough to make me send it back. \nDefinitely will return. Fast wait staff, great food, tasty drinks, nice decor!",

Heard \"I'm sorry about that, I'll take care of it\", probably ten times with other patrons. On the plus side, the food was good, plentiful and reasonably priced. The ownership needs to train their staff before putting them in front of customers. Still looks like a Bennigan's inside and the men's room stunk of stale urine. There was no ambient music playing only TV's. They have potential, but need to spend more time on the facility and the staff. It could be a great little place.",

I informed that I was only ordering two meals and there was still confusion about placing an order for pick up. The phone was handed to woman and they sated I could make an order for pick up that's two meals. I asked for a Monte Cristo which comes with fries. I asked if I could substitute the fries with cheese curds and the woman's response was it'll be $2 more I said that's not a problem, she then stated she was actually unsure of the cost and went to ask how much it would be. She came back to the phone and informed me the substitute was not possible to be made. I told them I'd take my business elsewhere. This review isn't based on the food, but rather the service I received on the phone. No one was sure of what could be done and there were many complications included with simple questions. Unfortunately due to this first time bad experience I will not be dining at this location.",

My boss wanted to take me to lunch. I said sure! It is very popular, the parking lot was packed at lunch, and the restaurant was buzzing with activity. It is apparently known for its deep fried food. They have a couple of heart-healthy items on the lunch menu, so I chose the baked tilapia. The accompanying salad and bread were delicious. I ate around the edges of the fish while talking to my boss and noticed the center was impossible to cut with a fork. I didn't want to interrupt her, so I stopped eating. Upon further examination, though, I found the fish was still frozen in the thickest part and raw in the middle. The waitress hadn't checked back since we started eating the entree, so when she brought the check, I told her the fish was raw in the middle. The restaurant withdrew the charge and tried to make it right - for that they get credit. But when you only have a couple of healthy items on the menu and can't do one of them right, I am not sure I would sign up for going back. Raw fish is kind of a no-no unless you are eating at a sushi place.",

We each had the glazed carrots and I had the black beans my wife had the mashed potatoes and gravy. Everything was great. We had the chocolate brownie with ice-cream for dessert (must have!). After we finished, we talked for at least another hour. We were there for three hours and NEVER felt rushed. The waitress was helpful but left us alone. It was a wonderful evening with friends.

The place is friendly and the food is amazing.. our waitress provided awesome service and was very personable.  They had so many things that sounded good it was hard to pick so we ordered appetizers we never heard of and then 2 of us got the the combo platters, one got the rib eye steak and one got the mac n cheese pulled pork sandwich. Everything was amazing and you get so much food!  I took home my leftovers from the combo and it fed me and my husband again!  This place is on our list to try again!  Highly recommend!",

They didn't have the beer they were advertising with a giant lighted beer sign. The tomato sauce was so salty and flavorless it was barely edible. The \"Italian hamburger\" is basically a giant flattened rubbery meatball. The bread was soggy and not toasted, the wait person didn't even ask if I wanted cheese on it or fries. And best of all, it was served at room temperature. I had to chase down our check at the end of the meal. The three of us agreed that it is not on our list of places to eat again. It is a shame because several co-workers said it was good and now I have to report, no, it is not.",

We had a lasagna and spaghetti with marinara sauce with two good size meatballs. The portions were huge, we immediately ask for take home boxes.

The entire staff and management there all need to be properly trained. Food took about an hour for a basic Pizza and there was only one other family with  4 employees on staff. Everything we ordered was wrong. Pizza was black on the bottom. Had to send Pizza back so they could cut it. Then still had to cut ourselves as it was only half way cut. If I was the owner I would be embarrassed to have a staff like this.Waitress took our drink orders and 15 min later came back and asked us what we wanted to drink again?. Horrible ☹️😣.",

I called to inform, not just complain, that they used to be awesome and to please get their management in order. Our last 3 visits, waiting to pickup an order, involved listening to phones ringing, staff not caring, an apparent owner yelling at his staff, but no cars in the lot. Tonight I was asked what they could do for me. I told him we didn't want anything free, that we were glad we got the 35% email off the price, and that we would now be going to Rock Falls until they had new owners or new staff. Such a shame. Right off of 88, could be a thriving business.",

The closest we found was Fiesta Cancun in Rockford, IL 55 miles away, or Jalapenos in Peru, IL 35 miles away. Mr. Tequilas has a very diverse menu with maybe 100 or more dishes to choose from. We just might go broke attempting to try every item! The portions are generous, their variety of sauces incomparable. Very nice atmosphere, polite and cordial wait staff and very competitive prices.

The service was good despite the fact the restaurant was packed and there were no open tables. The bar was crowded as well. Pretty much, people were being turned away at the door. So, I highly recommend reservations. I would have given this five stars except for one thing: My mate ordered the beef pad Thai, and there was very little meat in the dish. One item of note: Elliott, the bartender and manager, is extraordinarily easy on the eyes. We will be returning, no doubt.",

First impressions of the immediate greeting with a smile, soothing atmosphere, well thought out seating floor plan and liquor counter placement were perfect.  Drink options were plentiful, and food options not overwhelming.  A perfect balance of food.  The Pad Woonsen was flavorful and executed to perfection.  Tropical Roll was a sublime balance of fish to rice with the sauces delicately drizzled atop.  The presentation was well done with the placement of the garnish as to not be in the way but a subtle reminder of what was in front. From the light exposure to the black marble counter and intriguing design of the interior with the use of iron piping and light color wood shelving, a great touch of rustic class.  Elliot(t) and the Somkit service family presented an evening to remember and return to, hungry for more.",

After standing for 10 minutes, yes I timed it, without anyone acknowledging us, even though there were 3 employees there. We were asked what we wanted,  my husband asked for wheat bread, nope they didn't have any. We did have time to look around as we waited for service, one of the dirtiest shops I've been in. The glass around the food was covered in dried food. We didn't eat, very happy that we drove to the Subway near the high school on Everett.  We felt welcome at this Subway.  Subway is kinda like McDonald's, when you are traveling, you can count on them for good, clean facilities and consistent food.

When my husband went to the counter to ask about it he was told we would have to pay more for more cookies. Our order was already 30.00! I don’t know how the girl rang us up but we definitely were not going to pay more for what we should have gotten in the first place. The three young girls working were very rude to us as well. Not a smile or a thank you or anything. Looked like we were bothering them by being there.",
